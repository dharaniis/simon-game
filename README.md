# Simon Game

## About 
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game challenges players to memorize and repeat sequences of colored lights and sounds. With each correct round, the sequence becomes progressively longer. 
The project features a responsive design, interactive user interface, and sound effects to simulate the original Simon game experience. It is an ideal project for practicing front-end development skills with jQuery and CSS animations.
